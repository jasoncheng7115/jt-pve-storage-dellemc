# Release Test Plan

繁體中文：[RELEASE_TESTING_zh-TW.md](RELEASE_TESTING_zh-TW.md)

Every release runs this plan first. Stages 1 to 3 need no array and must pass
on every release without exception. Stage 4 needs hardware; while no array is
available, record it as not executed rather than skipping it silently — the
release notes have to stay honest about what was tested.

---

## Stage 1 — Automated checks

```bash
make release-check
```

That runs, and must all pass:

| Check | What it catches |
|---|---|
| `make check-multipath-flush` | the system-wide flush appearing anywhere in the tree |
| `make syntax` | a module that will not compile |
| `make unit` | every unit test |
| version consistency | `Makefile`, `debian/changelog` and `bin/pve-dell-config-get` disagreeing |
| changelog presence | the new version missing from `CHANGELOG.md` or `CHANGELOG_zh-TW.md` |

Run `make syntax` on a **Proxmox VE node** as well. On a machine without PVE
the modules that subclass `PVE::Storage::Plugin` report as skipped, which is
honest but not coverage:

```bash
make syntax
# Expected on a PVE node: every module "... OK", nothing skipped
```

---

## Stage 2 — Package

```bash
make deb
dpkg-deb -c ../jt-pve-storage-dellemc_*_all.deb | grep -E 'perl5|bin/'
```

Expected: the four plugin modules, the `DellEMC/` tree, and
`/usr/bin/pve-dell-config-get` at mode 0755.

```bash
dpkg-deb -I ../jt-pve-storage-dellemc_*_all.deb | grep -E 'Version|Depends'
```

Expected: the version matches `debian/changelog`, and Depends lists
`proxmox-ve`, the four Perl modules, `open-iscsi`, `multipath-tools`,
`sg3-utils`, `psmisc`.

---

## Stage 3 — Install on a Proxmox VE node

Use a node that already has other storages configured. The point of this
stage is that installing the package changes nothing for them.

```bash
pvesm status > /tmp/before.txt          # baseline
apt install ./jt-pve-storage-dellemc_*_all.deb
```

Expected: postinst prints the multipath safety rules, reports iscsid and
multipathd, and reloads the PVE services without error.

### 3.1 Existing storages are unaffected

```bash
pvesm status > /tmp/after.txt
diff /tmp/before.txt /tmp/after.txt
```

Expected: no storage changed state. A `duplicate property` failure at this
point takes down **every** storage on the node, so this diff is the single
most important check in the whole plan.

### 3.2 All four types register

```bash
perl -e 'use PVE::Storage;
  my $p = PVE::Storage::Plugin->private()->{plugins};
  print join(", ", grep { /dell/ } sort keys %$p), "\n";'
```

Expected: `dellpowerflex, dellpowerstore, dellpowervault`

### 3.3 Schema validation

```bash
pvesm add dellpowerstore t1
# Expected: missing value for required option 'dell-username'

pvesm add dellpowervault t2 --dell-portal 1.2.3.4 --dell-username u \
    --dell-password p --pvault-tier-affinity bogus
# Expected: value 'bogus' does not have a value in the enumeration

pvesm add dellpowerflex t3 --dell-portal 1.2.3.4 --dell-username u \
    --dell-password p
# Expected: missing value for required option 'pflex-storage-pool'

pvesm add dellpowerflex t4 --dell-portal 1.2.3.4 --dell-username u \
    --dell-password p --pflex-storage-pool p1 --pflex-nvme-ctrl-loss-tmo 9999
# Expected: value must have a maximum value of 600
```

### 3.4 An unreachable array fails cleanly

```bash
pvesm add dellpowerstore t5 --dell-portal 10.255.255.1 --dell-username u \
    --dell-password p --dell-status-timeout 2 --content images
```

Expected: creation fails with a message naming the storage and the address,
and **no** entry is left in `/etc/pve/storage.cfg`.

```bash
time pvesm status
```

Expected: answers in a couple of seconds and every other storage is still
active. A slow storage must not starve its neighbours — that is what
`dell-status-timeout` exists for.

### 3.5 The recovery tool

```bash
pve-dell-config-get --help
pve-dell-config-get nosuchstore 100
# Expected: names the storage, and suggests recover mode
```

---

## Stage 4 — On hardware

Per family, and only meaningful with a real array. The full 26-item matrix is
in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md); run it in full for a family the first time that
family is released, and run the subset below for a release that only changes
shared code.

### 4.1 Subset for a shared-code change

| # | Test | Pass criteria |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `pvesm status` | capacity matches the array's own UI within 1% |
| 2 | Create a disk | volume on the array, device on the node |
| 3 | Write and read back | `dd` in and out, checksums match |
| 4 | Snapshot, then roll back | data returns to the snapshot state |
| 5 | Linked clone from a template | completes in seconds, not minutes |
| 6 | Delete the disk | volume gone, no device or map left behind |
| 7 | Live migration | completes with no I/O interruption |
| 8 | Pull one path | I/O continues; the path shows as failed |
| 9 | Reboot a node | logs in and devices reappear automatically |

### 4.2 Per family, additionally

**PowerStore** — after 300 attach/detach cycles, LUN ids are still low and
dense (this is the Dell defect the plugin works around).

**PowerVault ME** — a storage id long enough to overflow 32 bytes is refused
at creation with a message naming the limit, not truncated.

**PowerFlex** — `nvme list-subsys` shows one subsystem with several paths in
`optimized`/`non-optimized` ANA state, and
`cat /sys/module/nvme_core/parameters/multipath` is `Y`. With SDC instead,
`drv_cfg --query_vols` lists the volume.

### 4.3 Soak, before 1.0.0 only

- 72 hours of pvestatd polling with no false `inactive` and no error
  accumulation in the journal
- management network cut for 10 minutes and restored: the storage returns to
  `active` on its own and running VMs see no I/O interruption

---

## Stage 5 — Publish

Only after stages 1 to 3 pass and stage 4 is either done or explicitly
recorded as not executed.

```bash
# 1. Version. The patch number increments per release and runs to .99
#    before the minor number moves: 0.7.0, 0.7.1, ... 0.7.99, then 0.8.0.
#    Update all three, in step:
#      Makefile                 VERSION
#      debian/changelog         a new entry at the top
#      bin/pve-dell-config-get  $VERSION
#
# 2. Changelog, in BOTH languages
#      CHANGELOG.md  CHANGELOG_zh-TW.md
#
# 3. Re-run the checks with the new version in place
make release-check

# 4. Build and keep the package in the repository. Every release stays:
#    releases/ is the archive, so a tester can fetch exactly the build
#    they are running. Add the new file, never replace the old one.
make deb
cp ../jt-pve-storage-dellemc_<version>_all.deb releases/

# 5. Commit, tag, push
git add -A && git commit
git tag -a v<version> -m 'Release <version>'
git push origin main --tags
```

The tag also triggers a GitHub release with the same `.deb` and a
`SHA256SUMS` attached. The workflow refuses to publish when the tag and
`debian/changelog` disagree.

### After publishing

```bash
# On a node, install the published package rather than a local build
apt install ./jt-pve-storage-dellemc_<version>_all.deb
pvesm status        # every storage still active
```
