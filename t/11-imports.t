# Two of them, both about things Perl accepts happily and an operator pays for
# later: a helper called without its `use` line, and a die whose message does
# not end at a newline.
#
# `perl -c` compiles a call to an undefined subroutine without a word of
# complaint, so a helper used without its `use` line only fails at runtime —
# and on this plugin the runtime path in question is the one that needs an
# array, which is exactly where it cannot be exercised here. One such slip
# (decode_json in PowerStore/API.pm, added while fixing collection paging)
# reached a commit and was found by hand. This makes it fail in the suite.

# Chinese text uses full-width punctuation
#
# CLAUDE.md has said so from the start, and it is the rule most easily lost
# when writing quickly: a half-width comma between two Chinese characters
# reads as wrong to a Taiwanese reader in the way a missing space between
# English words reads to an English one. 219 of them accumulated across the
# zh-TW changelog, the docs site and the testing document before somebody
# pointed at a screenshot.
#
# Anything inside backticks is left alone: a code span, a path or a command
# keeps the punctuation the machine needs. Both directions are checked — a
# Chinese character before the mark, and a Chinese character after it, which
# is the case that hides behind a code span (`--host-mode`,並且).
