# The recovery tool's credential lookup.
#
# pve-dell-config-get is the thing someone runs when PVE itself will not, so
# it parses storage.cfg by hand rather than going through the storage layer.
# 0.7.86 moved the array password OUT of storage.cfg and into
# /etc/pve/priv/storage/<storeid>.pw, and this tool was not told — for four
# releases it answered "no credentials configured" for every storage that
# followed the new convention, at the moment someone was trying to recover a
# VM configuration.
#
# The script is driven as a real subprocess here, against a temporary tree.

# exists for is the one where PVE will not start. That independence is also
# why it drifts, and it has been left behind twice - by the password moving
# out of storage.cfg, and by 'dell-host-mode shared'. dell-name-prefix is the
# third thing that changes what it NAMES.

# Getting it wrong does not produce an error. It produces an empty listing,
# which reads as "there are no backups" at the moment somebody is recovering
