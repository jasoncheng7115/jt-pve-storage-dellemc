#
# NOT YET VERIFIED against hardware: PowerStore Manager is documented as
# accepting up to 128 characters for a volume name, with letters, digits and
# '_ - .' allowed. Confirm before relying on the full length; a name the array
# rejects surfaces as a failed volume create at the worst moment. See
# docs/TESTING.md.
#
# The inherited character rule stays deliberately narrower than PowerStore's:
# '.' separates a volume from its snapshot suffix in this plugin's own naming,
# so it must never appear inside a generated name even though the array would
# accept it.

# NOT VERIFIED against hardware. PowerStore's documented limit for a volume
# group name is not something Dell's own client enforces, so this follows the
# volume limit; encode_volume_group_name refuses a longer one here rather than
# letting the array refuse it halfway through a disk creation.

# The storeid's share of a volume name. Wider than the default because the

# snapshot name all have to fit alongside it.
