# PowerStore Manager REST client.
#
# The endpoints and request bodies here are the ones Dell's own
# python-powerstore SDK sends — PyPowerStore/utils/constants.py for the paths,
# provisioning.py for the payloads — and the initiator and os_type values are
# the enums ansible-powerstore documents. What is still unchecked is the
# RESPONSE field set: what the array puts in a row, which differs between 3.x
# and 4.x. Compare it against a real appliance's own Swagger UI at
# https://<mgmt-ip>/swaggerui — see docs/TESTING.md.
#
# Filtering follows PostgREST conventions, which PowerStore adopted:
#   name=eq.<value>            exact match
#   name=ilike.<prefix>*       case-insensitive match, '*' the documented
#                              wildcard (see _prefix_filter)
#   type=eq.Snapshot           enum match
# Filters are applied server-side, always. Listing every volume and filtering
# locally turns each poll into a full inventory transfer, and this plugin
# polls every ten seconds per node.

=head1 NOTES

Listing always filters server-side. This plugin polls every ten seconds per
node; fetching the whole volume inventory to filter locally would put that
load on the array's management gateway continuously.

LUN ids are assigned by this client rather than by the array. PowerStore's
REST-side automatic sequence starts at 200 and never reuses an id, so a
cluster that repeatedly attaches and detaches volumes eventually exceeds what
the host scans and new disks stop appearing.
