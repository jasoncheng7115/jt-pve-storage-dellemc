# The dell-* options every Dell EMC family shares, and the rule that decides
# which plugin declares them.
#
# PVE merges every registered plugin's properties() into ONE schema and dies
# with "duplicate property" if two plugins declare the same name — see
# PVE::SectionConfig::init. That failure is not scoped to the offending
# plugin: it happens while PVE builds the storage schema, so every storage on
# the node stops working.
#
# So exactly one registered class may declare the shared options. Whichever
# family PVE asks first takes the job; the rest declare only their own. This
# lives here rather than in BlockBase because PowerFlex needs the same shared
# options while having nothing else in common with a block plugin.

=head1 NAME

PVE::Storage::Custom::DellEMC::Common::Schema - the shared storage.cfg
options and the rule for declaring them once

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PVE merges every plugin's C<properties()> into one schema and dies on a
duplicate name, which takes down every storage on the node rather than just
the offending plugin. The shared C<dell-*> options are therefore declared by
whichever family class PVE asks first.
