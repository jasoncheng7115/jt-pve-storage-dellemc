# Host-side device handling shared by the Dell EMC block plugins. Ported from
# the Pure Storage and NetApp ONTAP plugins, with the vendor gate turned into
# a parameter.
#
# Two rules run through the whole module and must survive any edit:
#
#   1. `multipath -F` (capital F) is never generated. It flushes every unused
#      map on the node, including storage this plugin does not own. Only
#      `multipath -f <device>` appears here, and multipath_flush() refuses to
#      run without a device argument.
#
#   2. Nothing touches the kernel without a bound on how long it may block.
#      Storage that stops answering puts a plain open()/read() into
#      uninterruptible sleep (D state), which no signal clears; the process
#      is then unkillable and every later caller queues behind it, which is
#      how a single dead LUN takes down pvestatd and pvedaemon on a node.
#      Every sysfs access goes through a forked, timeout-bounded helper and
#      every external command through _run_cmd's alarm.

=head1 NAME

PVE::Storage::Custom::DellEMC::Common::Multipath - dm-multipath and SCSI
device handling for the Dell EMC plugins

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use PVE::Storage::Custom::DellEMC::Common::Multipath qw(
        wait_for_multipath_device
        cleanup_lun_devices
        is_device_in_use
    );

    my $device = wait_for_multipath_device($wwid, timeout => 60);
    cleanup_lun_devices($wwid);          # BEFORE deleting on the array

=head1 SAFETY

C<multipath -F> is never generated. C<multipath_flush> requires a device and
refuses to run without one; a CI check fails the build if the capital-F form
appears anywhere in the tree.

Every sysfs access is a forked, timeout-bounded child and every command runs
under an alarm, because a plain read of an unresponsive device puts the
process into uninterruptible sleep that no signal clears.

Destructive sweeps are vendor-gated. See C<default_vendor_re>, whose value is
NOT yet verified against hardware.

C<cleanup_lun_devices> must run before the volume is deleted on the array,
never after.
