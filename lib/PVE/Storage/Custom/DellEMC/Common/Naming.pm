# Naming is family-agnostic here; the per-family length and character limits
# are class methods so that a family module can override them:

#     use base 'PVE::Storage::Custom::DellEMC::Common::Naming';
#     sub max_volume_name_length { 128 }

# Everything is a class method rather than an exported function on purpose:
# one PVE process (pvedaemon, pvestatd) loads every Dell plugin at once, so
# limits must never live in package-global mutable state.

=head1 NAME

PVE::Storage::Custom::DellEMC::Common::Naming - object naming shared by the
Dell EMC storage plugins

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use PVE::Storage::Custom::DellEMC::Common::Naming;
    my $N = 'PVE::Storage::Custom::DellEMC::Common::Naming';

    $N->encode_volume_name('ps1', 100, 0);   # pve-ps1-100-disk0
    $N->decode_volume_name('pve-ps1-100-disk0');
    # { storage => 'ps1', vmid => 100, diskid => 0, type => 'disk' }

    $N->pve_volname_to_array('ps1', 'vm-100-disk-0');  # pve-ps1-100-disk0
    $N->array_to_pve_volname('pve-ps1-100-disk0');     # vm-100-disk-0

    $N->is_pve_managed_volume('pve-ps1-100-disk0', 'ps1');  # 1
    $N->is_pve_managed_volume('production-lun-7', 'ps1');   # 0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

All methods are class methods so a family module can subclass this one and
override the length limits without introducing shared mutable state — a
single PVE process loads every Dell plugin at once.

=head1 SAFETY

C<is_pve_managed_volume> is the ownership gate for every destructive path.
Call it with the storeid; the two-argument form only proves that the name
looks like some PVE plugin's, which does not authorize deleting it.
