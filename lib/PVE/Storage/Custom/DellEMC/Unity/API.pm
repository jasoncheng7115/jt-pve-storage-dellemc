# driver uses against Unity — rather than from prose about Unisphere. Where
# the two disagreed, the code won: a documentation page gives the LUN name
# limit as 85 and Dell's client refuses anything over 63 before it reaches
# the array.

# The handful of calls gounity does not make, because a CSI driver does not
# need them, are marked NOT VERIFIED individually. docs/TESTING.md is the

# Restore a LUN to a snapshot.
#
# The endpoint is NOT VERIFIED: gounity does not restore a snapshot, because a
# CSI driver has no reason to, so this is the documented action form and
# nothing more. It is also the most destructive call here, which is why the
# plugin's rollback path proves nothing on this node is using the device
# before it can be reached.
#
# 'copyName' is not optional in any way that matters. Dell's own white paper:
#
#   "When restoring LUNs, the system automatically creates a backup snapshot
#    associated with the current point-in-time which allows administrators to
#    reverse this operation..."
#
# So every rollback leaves a snapshot behind whether or not one was asked
# for. Left to the array, it gets a name of the array's choosing - which this
# plugin's own snapshot purge does not recognise, and which the ownership
# gate would refuse to delete even if it did. Unity then refuses to delete a
# LUN that still has snapshots, and the volume becomes undeletable: `qm
# destroy` fails from then on, days after the rollback that caused it, with
# nothing pointing back at it.

#

# hostAccess REPLACES the list; it does not add to it. Sending only this
# node's host unmaps the volume from every other node in the cluster, and a
# guest on one of them is then writing to a device that has gone. Dell's own
# client shipping both ExportVolume (one host) and ModifyVolumeExport (a
# list) is the tell.
#
# So both directions here read the current list first and send the union or
# the difference. The read has to happen inside whatever retry loop wraps the
# write, because PVE runs these in parallel: a list read before another node's
# write and sent after it puts back exactly the state that write removed.
